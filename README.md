# Vector Racing

This is a simple Haskell-learning attempt to code a turn-based
car racing game running in a tty. By no means do I consider this
"good coding practices", so do not slash me open with ocam's
razor please.

Also, I would need sometime to make this code understandable,
cause I don't really get what I was trying to do anymore.
Even comments don't make sense.
